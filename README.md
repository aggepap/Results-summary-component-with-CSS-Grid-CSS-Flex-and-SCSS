## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS (SCSS with BEM Syntax)

### What I learned

I tried this challenge to get better in my css. Its was my first time working with hls colors, and i found it really amusing, even though i'll stick to RGB for now.

### Continued development

I'd like to get better in CSS Flexbox and responsive design, and also, i need a lot more practice to do basic stuff much faster.

### Useful resources

- [MDN webdock](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This helped me for font face, as i've never used a local font file before..
